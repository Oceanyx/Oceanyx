 # Hi there, I'm Brian aka Oceanyx 🌙



## About | [Portfolio](https://oceanyx.github.io)



I've always been fascinated by how things work, which naturally led me to coding. I love building things, writing code, and exploring the deeper patterns in how humans and technology interact.



Take React, for example—it abstracts DOM manipulation so developers can focus on building UIs without worrying about the underlying mechanics. In a way, life works similarly. Society abstracts concepts like "good" and "virtuous," shaping behavior without always questioning their true meaning or utility. Just as developers may struggle to grasp the deeper purpose of a framework beyond its abstraction, people can sometimes feel lost in life, following ideals without ever examining their foundations—especially since these ideals are constantly evolving, much like how frameworks shift and adapt to the needs of the current age.



When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading, writing, working out, watching anime/movies, gaming, or having deep conversations. I may be a little shy at first, but I’m naturally curious and creative—so feel free to reach out for a chat! I believe in lifelong learning and love sharing knowledge.
